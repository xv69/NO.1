Hello,I am huyuchen.
This is my first repositoryã€‚
I'll post some code about arduino here, don't look at the code I wrote without comments, I'm only 10 years old.

It's a great project for me.
Water dispenser, that's a good name.
If I have time, I'll go to blilblil to share the wiring.
It doesn't need to be compiled, just upload it to the Arduino IDE.
